## Problem Statement
The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus and its resulting condition, COVID-19, has caught much of the world off-guard. The tragedy has yet to fully play out, but what about Saudi Arabia? is going to face a harsh second wave of COVID-19 cases. Are we heading to another recession?. Is this recession would be tougher than 2016-17 
recession.

I am going to try answering these questions by using advanced models to predict the future of Saudi Arabia or at least until the end of 2020. The project is going to be updated with a new forecast or results every week..
