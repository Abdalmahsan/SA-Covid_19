The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus and its resulting condition, COVID-19, has caught much of the world off-guard. The tragedy has yet to fully play out, but it is already clear that the crisis is thoroughly global in nature and that science is on the front lines in the fight against the virus. This includes medical professionals attempting to heal the sick at risk to their own health, public health officials tracking the virus and vigilantly urging such measures as social distancing to mitigate its spread, and researchers now engaged in the development of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines.
